        Here's my entire content freewrite/rough draft: Main topic #1- Overview

        Overview:
        The user will find themselves at the home page, which offers a short introduction and then a list of projects that they can choose from to view step-by-step instructions for.  I was planning on just using pictures and instructions from my own projects, but I’m not opposed to using free to use pictures online either.  I’m lucky to have a workshop and a decent amount of tools to work with, although it’s not terribly expansive.
        
        Why will people come to your site?
        I hope that people will come to my site to find some fun, free ideas and plans for woodworking projects that might interest them.  It’s the kind of thing that I always enjoyed growing up, and still continue to enjoy today.  I want to keep the projects easy to moderate in terms of difficulty, as projects that are too complex tend to either be too tedious to be enjoyable to the average or beginner craftsman, or it may require the use of various tools that are too expensive or unique that most people may not have access to them.
        
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        I think it will answer the question of “what fun things can I do with a free weekend?”  Or “what are some fun projects I could work on as I begin to get into woodworking?”  It’s meant to be a fun and creative place to learn from.  Ideally, I would also create my website so that people could upload their own projects and tutorials, similar to instructables if you’ve ever seen their website.  But, for the sake of simplicity and the semester project, I will limit this website to projects I make.
        
        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        My site really doesn’t have a whole lot to do on the site itself.  It is meant to be informative and help people to create neat projects outside of, but with help from, the website.
        
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
        None.  My site does not participate in any actions, and is only informational.
        
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?:
        They are free to go to any site they choose, and this is not a site in which anything is monetized, it is purely recreational.  Were it a business, or online store, I would work on advertising, search engine optimization, etc, to try and direct the flow of internet traffic to my site.  I would probably just share the site on social media, and let it grow via word of mouth, etc., but I wouldn’t be super concerned with the site’s performance in this instance.  It is not competitive.
        Main Idea #2- Page 2, Birdhouse
        Since the project requires that we have a home page and two child pages, I think I’ll limit myself to 2 woodworking projects for this assignment.  I’m thinking of maybe doing a birdhouse for one, and I’m not entirely sure what to do for the second one
        
        Main Idea #3- Page 3, Walking Stick
        
        A crossbow maybe?  I made one a while back and could probably slap a basic one together without too much effort.  Or perhaps I could do one on carving intricate walking sticks.  I really enjoy making walking sticks using relief carving, and have made plenty.  I think that might be the better option just because I’ve had more experience with it.  I think the only tools people would need for the projects are a saw, knife, pencil, drill, measuring tape/ruler, screws/hammer and nails/wood glue and clamps, and wood.  I think most people should have access to those, and it should help keep things simple.
