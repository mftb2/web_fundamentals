        <h2>Taylor Cazier</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone, as you might've guessed, my name's Taylor, and I'm excited to get to know you all this semester.  I'm originally from Texas,
             and just moved to Oregon with my wife, our son, dog and cat from Rexburg.  I enjoy the outdoors, and we love going fishing on the weekends 
             at the lake down the road.  I'm majoring in computer IT, and am hoping to graduate by the end of next year if all goes according to plan!</p>
